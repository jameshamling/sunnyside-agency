# Frontend Mentor - Sunnyside agency landing page solution

This is a solution to the [Sunnyside agency landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/sunnyside-agency-landing-page-7yVs3B6ef). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

This project was built as a Frontend Mentor challenge focused on layout and responsive design, and there was a small amount of JavaScript needed to make the mobile menu work.

In this build I challenged myself to use SCSS for the first time. I found it overall very intuative to work with and I think the completion time was shorter because of it. I mostly used it for nesting variables, which I found gave the stylesheet better readability.
